              media, particularly Facebook, Leslie's Pizza quickly gained popularity
              among a diverse customer base. <b>The shop's origins in the pastry and
              bread industry</b>, coupled with its catering background, have
              contributed to the quality and variety of their pizza offerings.
              Additionally, partnering with popular food delivery platforms like
              Foodpanda has allowed Leslie's Pizza to cater to a wider customer base.
              Amidst challenging times, Leslie's Pizza has thrived by serving
              delicious pizzas that have become a favorite among pizza enthusiasts
              across the region.

            <p className="p2-head">
              It all began with a simple Facebook post. Previously known for our
              expertise in pastries, bread, and catering services, we decided to
              embark on a new culinary adventure. Leveraging the existing online
              presence of our cake and pastry business, we introduced pizza to our
              menu. In July 2020, our pizza journey officially started.
              <br />
              <br />
              Recognizing the growing demand for convenient food options, we joined
              forces with Foodpanda, a popular food delivery platform. This
              partnership allowed us to reach a wider customer base and cater to the
              increasing number of pizza lovers. By November 2020, we became a
              registered partner of Foodpanda, further solidifying our commitment to
              delivering mouthwatering pizzas to our valued customers.
              <br />
              <br />
              Behind the scenes, our dedicated team works tirelessly to bring you
              the best pizza experience. <b>Eilsel</b> takes care of the preparation
              process, ensuring that every ingredient is of the highest quality.
              <b>Angeline</b>, our skilled chef, masterfully crafts each pizza in our oven,
              infusing them with flavors that will leave you craving for more. <b>Leslie</b>,
              with his creative touch, contributes to both the culinary and visual
